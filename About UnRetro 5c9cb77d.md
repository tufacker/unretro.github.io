### Welcome to UnRetro!

Many things that are now considered old are being brought back to life by enthusiastic communities willing to support and prolong their hobbies, best described by a few words:

*Rescue, Repair, Restore, Rediscover, Enhance, Preserve*

This site is a personal wiki used to keep track of my various retrocomputing exploits. Anything that I find interesting or useful is most likely useful to others as well. In the spirit of contributing I'd like to make my experiences available for others to potentially find benefit.

The following are sites with a like-minded purpose, that I personally find interesting.
