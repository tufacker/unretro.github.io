### Mitsumi Keyboard Repair

I had an issue where two of my TIs had keyboards with bad keys or were totally unresponsive. Dissasembly and removal of the keyboard membrane did the trick. Peel it off carefully and then lay it back down right where it was. Apparently this 'resets' the membrane to allow proper triggering of keystrokes.\

I replaced the fan in my PEB with a very quiet 12v fan. Here's the docs for that.\

I also installed a TIPI in the PEB along with a Raspberry Pi 3b. Be extra careful with the cabling as described here.\
