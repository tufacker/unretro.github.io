### SIO Devices

* [RespeQt](https://github.com/jzatarski/RespeQt) - RespeQt emulates Atari SIO peripherals when connected to an Atari 8-bit computer with an SIO2PC cable. In that respect it's similar to programs like APE and Atari810. The main difference is that it's free (unlike APE) and it's cross-platform (unlike Atari810 and APE).

### Disk Preservation

---

### Disks and Drives

The first thing to take into consideration is the type of disks you're backing up. If you're like me, you've got a bunch of 5.25 inch disks that are notched and have data on both sides. Back in the day, this was a way to save some cash - but today it'll probably cost you some cash! You'll need a PC floppy drive capable of reading a “flippy” disk, so prepare to either a DIY or purchase a modded drive.

* The truth about the troubling [flippy disks](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/4226)!
* A breakdown and explanation of the mod and where to get a [modded drive](http://reset.cbm8bit.com/split/issue2/issue_2%2057.pdf).

### Archiving Options

No brainer here, get a Kyroflux. The SuperCard Pro is an up and comer and will even let you directly create ATRs, but the software is less mature and the Kyroflux is enormously popular and supported.

* [Kyroflux](http://webstore.kryoflux.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=1&osCsid=ca428ce47a8bbfb56793f7c861268849)
* [SuperCard Pro](http://www.cbmstuff.com/proddetail.php?prod=scp)
* [Atarimax APE/ProSystem](http://www.atarimax.com/)

### Kyroflux

The Kyroflux is currently the best solution for archiving old Atari floppies. You'll attach the Kyroflux to a Mac/PC/Linux machine and attach a PC floppy drive to it. You're then able to 'rip' the disk into a stream file for processing. Once the disk is ripped, you're good to go. Put it away, hang it on the wall, you're done with it.

* [Info-Coach](http://info-coach.fr/atari/software/pc-projects/analyzer.php) - Project page for DrCoolZic's Kyroflux experiments.

### DTC Command Line Examples

*To create a Kyroflux preservation stream of a “flippy” or notched 2-sided Atari disk*

```
dtc -p -f[DiskName]\track_ -g2 -y -i0 -i2 -k2 -b-8
```

### a8rawconv

An amazing utility that converts data from Kyroflux (or SCP) stream files into ATR/ATX files.

[http://atariage.com/forums/topic/231835-a8rawconv-a-new-raw-disk-conversion-utility](http://atariage.com/forums/topic/231835-a8rawconv-a-new-raw-disk-conversion-utility)

*Creating ATR files using a8rawconv of both sides of a disk*

```
a8rawconv [DiskName]\track_00.0.raw [DiskNameA].atr
a8rawconv -r [DiskName]\track_00.1.raw [DiskNameB].atr
```

*Here's a handy DOS batch file that covers the whole raw stream + ATR creation process. Call it rip.bat and just provide a diskname when running \[rip.bat disk27\].*

```
echo off
set arg1=%1
shift
dtc -p -f%arg1%\track_ -g2 -y -i0 -i2 -k2 -b-8 -tc5 -t10
a8rawconv %arg1%\track_00.0.raw %arg1%a.atr
a8rawconv -r %arg1%\track_00.1.raw %arg1%b.atr
```
