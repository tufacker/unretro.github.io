## The Mighty SE/30

* Documentation
  * [http://www.vintagemacworld.com/macmain.html](http://www.vintagemacworld.com/macmain.html)
  * [Full of Mac](http://www.biwa.ne.jp/\~shamada/full_of_macE.html) - Great technical info on adjusting and repairing the monitor and other tech tidbits.
* System Board
  * [BMOW Mac ROM-inator II](http://www.bigmessowires.com/mac-rom-inator-ii/) - The Mac ROM-inator II replaces the stock Macintosh ROM with a programmable flash memory module. Add a bootable ROM disk, change the startup chime, hack the icons, gain HD20 support and get a 32-bit clean ROM. The Mac ROM-inator supports the Macintosh IIx, IIcx, IIci, IIfx, IIsi, and SE/30.
  * [MacCaps](http://maccaps.com/MacCaps/Repair_Service.html) - Have your innards re-capped by a pro, I hear the surface mount caps in the SE/30 are a bitch.
  * [Retrofixes Mac Recap](http://store.retrofixes.com/collections/mod-kits-repair-parts/products/macintosh-board-re-cap-service-more-coming-soon?variant=6808323201) - A $55 recap option for Macs. Not yet available but says it's coming soon…
  * [Stratos DualSlot Adapter](http://www.artmix.com/ts_adapter.html) - From my favorite guys at Artmix/Stratos Tech comes an adapter than allows the use of a PDS card + accelerator card at the same time. Expensive, but if you need it then you can swing it.
  * [Stratos STR Power Unit](http://www.artmix.com/hps_2009_EVO.html) - Upgraded high power supply for accelerated SE/30s.
* Memory
  * [We Love Macs SE/30 Memory](http://www.welovemacs.com/apple-memory-mac-ii--mac-se--classic-se30.html) - Everything you need right here and cheap!
* Floppy Emulation
  * [BMOW Floppy Emu Model B](http://www.bigmessowires.com/floppy-emu/) - Hangs off the DB19 (which were re-manufactured specifically for this project) and provides an iPod style display for selecting images.
* Refurbishing
  * [Andrew's SE/30](https://68kmla.org/forums/index.php?/topic/27854-the-ongoing-saga-of-andrews-se30/) - 68kmla thread covering a troublesome refurbishment.
